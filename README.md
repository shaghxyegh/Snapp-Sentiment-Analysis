# Snapp-Sentiment-Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model for Persian comments, specifically targeting user reviews from services like Snapp (a ride-hailing and food delivery app). The model classifies comments as HAPPY (positive) or SAD (negative) using a fine-tuned BERT-based model.
